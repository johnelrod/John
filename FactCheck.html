    - The Ward with the most arrests is the 28th ward which includes West Garfied Park and other west side communities 
    - The 2nd most arrests is the 24th ward which is just south of the 28th and includes Little Village
    - The ward with the least amount of arrests is the 38th ward which is actually pretty close to the 28th to the north including Portage Park and Irving Park. An interesting angle for a story would be to examine how these two areas are policed and if there are any differences. Also what differences in overall resources and economic opportunities are there between the wards.

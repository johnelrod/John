     The win propels the Bills to their fifth straight Divisional Round appearance where they will host the Baltimore Ravens next weekend.

       Althought the final score might suggest it was an easy win for Buffalo, Denver opened the scoring with a 43-yard touchdown pass from Bo Nix to Troy Franklin on the first drive of the game.

      After the Bills got on the board with a Tyler Bass field goal, they took the lead for good on a James Cook rushing touchdown early in the second quarter. Cook finished with 120 yards on the day to help power Buffalo's offense. The dagger for the Bills came on the first play of the fourth quarter when Allen connected with Curtis Samuel for a 55-yard score.
